# Overview

This web application was created for a group capstone project for devCodeCamp. The task was to create an e-commerce web application that would allow users to post products for sale and to add other users' products to their shopping cart. My team went with a videogame theme, naming our application "Gamebay". With Gamebay, users can post video games for sale on various platforms, search the database for titles, and add/remove games from their shopping cart. The application stops short of allowing users to complete their purchases, but that is something I would like to add in the future in order to call this a true e-commerce platform.
